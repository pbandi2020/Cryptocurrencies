# Cryptocurrencies

## Unsupervised Data - Machine Learning 

Analyse a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.
We use the following methods for the analysis:

* Deliverable 1 - Preprocessing the database
* Deliverable 2 - Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis
* Deliverable 3 - Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
* Deliverable 4 - Visualizing classification results with 3D scatter plots

##  Resources

* **Data Source:** crypto_data.csv, CryptoCompare
* **Software:** Python, Jupyter Notebook

##  Results 

The preprocessed and transformed output used for analysis hs 532 rows of tradble cryptocurrencies. Since we don't know what would be the output of the analysis we are using unsupervised machine learning to identify clusters of the cryptocurrencies.
